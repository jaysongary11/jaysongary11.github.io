        <p class="aboutpara">
            I am a senior graduating in May 2021 at the University of Oklahoma and my major is Management Information Systems. In my free time I love to spend time
            with all of my animals. I have 3 birds, 2 snakes, a hedgehog and a dog. My family loves to call my room "The Zoo" because I have so many animals in there.
            I also love everything to do with technology so anytime I am not spending with my animals or in class, I will likely be using one of my many electronics
            such as my 3D printer, or on my desktop playing games.
