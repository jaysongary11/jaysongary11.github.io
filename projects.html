            While in college there have been many projects that I have worked on that showcase the skills that I have been able to develop within my degree program. 
            This page is to show you some of the things I have worked on while in school.

                <li><p>Databases - While in my databases class, we were tasked with creating a database from scratch that would keep track of a companies inventory and would
                    keep track of all of their customers data. We did this by creating the Entity Relationship Diagram for the database, and then we used Microsoft SQL Server 
                    to implement the database.</p></li>
